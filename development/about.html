    <p class="text-justify">Seishin in the Japanese language means true heart, true spirit, true being. At Seishin Martial Arts / Sport Karate Academy we take this as our basic philosophy in developing each student into fantastic individuals inside and outside the dojo. In doing so, students learn the importance of effort, etiquette, character, sincerity, and self-control. By using the physical and mental aspects of the Martial Arts as a guide, we aim to make a lasting impact on both students and the community as a whole.</p>
    <p class="text-justify">Seishin Martial Arts offers instruction from a staff including both National and World Champions from the karate competition circuits. Our highly skilled instructors are well-qualified in training students of all ages, ranks, and abilities. We are currently producing a new generation of champions, as well as students who are champions in their own right. Our staff is trained to work with high-caliber individuals who take a natural affinity for success in the sport, as well as students who need just a little extra attention to reach their goals. Our instructors have an extensive background working with students with ADD, ADHD, Cerebral Palsy, Learning Delay and Dyslexia, as well as those with particular physical limitations. Our staff also offers specialized instruction on an individual basis for students interested in private training classes and personal training programs.Seishin has produced more than a dozen state champions, fourteen national champions, and four world champions, eleven of whom have been members of the elite ”Team Straight Up” International Karate Team. Since 2002, Seishin has won at least one National Championship every year from the KRANE sport karate circuit. Seishin students and instructors have been featured in documentaries, commercials, music videos, and on ESPN.</p>
    <p class="text-justify">Just about anyone can benefit from the Martial Arts: Men, Women, and Children from ages 4 to adult. In class, students work with others of similar skill level and a comparable level of experience. Instructors provide personal attention to all students so that each individual can develop his or her karate skills at a comfortable pace.
