    <p class="text-justify">Students and instructors at Seishin Martial Arts / Sport Karate Academy are true veterans of the Sport Karate competition circuits. In fact, at least one member of Seishin has won a National Championship on the KRANE circuit every year since 2002 and eleven Seishin members have been invited onto the world renowned “Team Straight Up” international karate team. We attend numerous regional and national competitions throughout the year both on the KRANE and NASKA circuits.</p>
    <p class="text-justify">Tournament competition, while not a requirement, is an outstanding venue for students looking to obtain a greater understanding of the martial arts. Using competition as a vehicle, students are taught the important of setting goals and working hard to achieve them.</p>
    <p class="text-justify">Seishin’s history of tournament success begins before our doors were even open. Both Shihan Eric and Sensei Steve had found tournament success as members of “Team Cerio” in the late 1990s. In the early 2000s, they both began competing on the New England “KRANE” tournament circuit. In 2003, they were recruited onto Joe Greenhalgh’s Team Straight Up. Since, Seishin’s relationship with the prestigious team has only grown, with eleven Seishin students/instructors becoming members, most recently with assistant instructor Emily Civetti. Team Straight Up has been a dominant team on the KRANE and NASKA circuits for almost 20 years and is backed by G-Force Weapons, the leading sport karate weapons provider in the world.</p>
    <p class="text-justify">In 2013, after years of success in tournament competition, Seishin officially launched ”Team Seishin”, its very own competition team. Team Seishin attends numerous regional, national, and world tournaments throughout the year and has brought success to a new generation of champions! Each year, every tournament featured Team Seishin members placing in at least the top four of their divisions. In 2013, members earned State, National, and Overall Grand Championships on the KRANE circuit.</p>
    <p class="text-justify">Check out our very own Sensei Tim Pettepit and Sensei Kurt Marcinkiewicz at the Quebec Open World Martial Arts Championship. It is the biggest sport karate tournament in Canada and the largest sport karate night show in the world, with an audience of over 6000 people:</p>
