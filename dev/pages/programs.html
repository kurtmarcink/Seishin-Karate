            <p class="text-justify">Students and enthusiasts of martial arts have many reasons for their interest in the sport. Some are drawn to the physical fitness and weight-loss aspects of training while others seek to add discipline and self control to their lives, while still others are concerned about safety and self-defense. Whether you are interested in our programs for mental or physical well being, Seishin Martial Arts / Sport Karate Academy offers a number of programs that will fit your developmental needs and your busy schedule as well.</p>
            <h3 id="4-to-6-program">4-6 Year Old Program</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">This program is designed for children ages 4-6 years old. Classes focus on developing coordination, balance, and listening skills through the fun and excitement of the martial arts. Each class is 30 minutes long and consists of different sections to ensure that students have a well-rounded experience of mental and physical exercise. Instructors discuss important themes such as effort, responsibility, staying hydrated, etc. This exercises students’ cognitive processes as they are encouraged to answer and ask questions, as well as reach conclusions through deductive reasoning. Classes include specialized activity that is meant to improve one of many specific skills, such as catching, throwing, listening, running, hand-eye coordination. Additionally, students engage in martial arts practice during which students are taught to learn and remember basic martial arts techniques. The 4-6 Yr. Old Program is completely geared toward overall physical and mental development through repetition, fun, and self-confidence. Students learn to voice themselves to their instructors and fellow students in a way that is often suppressed in other activities targeting the young adolescent age group. The social improvement alone of students who graduate from the program is complete proof of its effectiveness. The kids make eye contact, address their peers and instructors in a cheerful/respectful manner and express astonishing focus. This program is suitable for a wide range of children of almost all physical and mental capabilities.</p>
            <h3 id="7-to-10-program">Children's Program <small>Ages 7-10</small></h3>
            <p class="text-justify">This program includes physical fitness training and character development through the martial arts. The classes are designed to enhance a student’s cardio vascular training as well as their muscular development through various karate related games, activities, and techniques. Instructors will talk with students and have them define and give examples of different things like etiquette, dealing with peer pressure, and staying organized. Classes often include a warm-up activity which teaches students about the different forms of exercise and their purposes. The majority of the class is spent working on the student’s belt curriculum in which they are expected to remember new techniques and perform at a progressively higher level from class-to-class. Our Children’s Program is geared towards shaping respectful and self-confident students through physical and mental exercise. Instructors of the program focus on group encouragement through individual goal-setting and ensuring that each student is pushed, not forced, to their personal limit. These classes benefit almost all children of the age group and can aid your child in reaching their full potential.</p>

Serving as role models to students, instructors help students not only become champions in the martial arts, but also champions in life.

            <h3 id="evolving-program">Evolving Martial Arts <small>Quality Instruction for All Ability Levels</small></h3>
            <p class="text-justify">Lead by World Martial Arts Federation Hall of Famer, Shihan Chuck Leverone, Evolving Martial Arts allows adult students of all ability levels pursue their goals of physically fitness and self-defense. Students will learn traditional Kenpo, as well as mixture of martial arts concepts, self-defense training, and the importance of fitness and fun. The goal is to equip people with essential martial skills, enabling them to have the most fundamental self-defense tools. Training also offers the additional benefits of stress relief, total body workout, self-empowerment, and the capacity to reinforce motivation in today’s fast paced environment. Traditional martial arts trains the student to combine a wide variety of techniques such as punches, kicks, blocks, katas (forms), joint locking and learning how to roll and fall correctly into one self-defense system. At the same time, students learn practical real world self-defense. As students grow in mind, body and spirit, they are able to make positive changes in their lives. This program meets Wednesdays at 7:30PM at our Medway Academy. Contact program director, Shihan Chuck Leverone for more information: (508) 517-8762.</p>
